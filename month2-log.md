# 📘 Monthly Work Log — Month 2 (Back-End Web Development)

## 🛠️ 1. Summary of What I Worked On
This month, I focused on learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python. I also started working with MySQL, learning how to create and manage databases, and how to integrate them into Python applications. I practiced CRUD operations and worked on back-end development basics.

## 🏆 2. Achievements
- Created Python classes and used inheritance and encapsulation.
- Set up MySQL databases and connected them using `mysql-connector-python`.
- Performed database operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with Python.
- Completed the ALX project “Discovering Databases”.

## 💡 3. Lessons from Challenges
- Had trouble debugging database connection errors but learned how to properly configure MySQL and Python.
- Found it challenging to understand foreign keys at first but now feel more confident defining and linking tables.
- Learned the importance of validating user input before sending it to the database.

## ✨ 4. Monthly Highlights
- Wrote my first real Python script that interacts with a MySQL database.
- Understood the practical use of classes and OOP principles.
- Posted my work log to GitHub and shared my progress with the ALX community on Discord.
